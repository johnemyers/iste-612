## Functions

Our app is composed of three main sections and functions.

1.  *Process Data.* Import and process the PDF documents, returning basic statistics.
2.  *Query Data.* Find a term or keyword using a configurable State Vector Model.
3.  *Explore Data.* A final thing.

These can be navigated to using the links on the left.
